### Task 2: Real-World Python Applications

#### Objective: Find three examples of how Python is used in different industries. Look for specific use cases such as web development, data analysis or AI

1. **Web Development:**
    - **Example:** Django and Flask frameworks are extensively used in web development. For instance, Instagram uses
      Django for its web application.

2. **Data Analysis:**
    - **Example:** Python is widely used for data analysis using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Companies
      like Netflix use Python for data analysis and visualization to improve their services and customer
      recommendations.

3. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
    - **Example:** Python is a popular language in AI and machine learning, with libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.
      Google uses Python for various AI and machine learning projects, including their TensorFlow library.
