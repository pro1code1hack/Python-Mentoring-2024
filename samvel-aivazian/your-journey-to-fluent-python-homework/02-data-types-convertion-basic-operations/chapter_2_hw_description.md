### Task 3: Simple Interest Calculator

**Objective**: Create a script to calculate simple interest.

```
Input: The user enters the principal amount, the rate of interest (as a percentage), and the time period in years.

Output: The script outputs the calculated simple interest.

Formula: Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100.
```

#### Example

```
Input: Principal = 1000, Rate = 5, Time = 3
Output: Simple Interest is 150.0
```
